# Open Cam: Web Camera Application

Open Cam is a web camera application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project incorporates the Media Stream API and IndexedDB to provide users with a rich experience in capturing and managing media content.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: The core technologies for building the user interface and managing application logic.

- **Media Stream API**: Utilized to access and manipulate camera streams, enabling real-time video capture.

- **IndexedDB**: The project leverages IndexedDB for client-side storage, allowing users to manage and download captured images and recorded videos.

## Features

### 1. Camera Access with Media Stream API

Open Cam uses the Media Stream API to access the user's camera, providing a live video stream within the application. This feature enables users to see a real-time preview from their web camera.

### 2. Image Capturing with Filters

Users can capture images through the application, and Open Cam enhances this feature by offering various filters for users to apply to their photos. This adds a creative element to the image capture process.

### 3. Video Recording

In addition to image capturing, the application supports video recording. Users can start and stop recording, creating video clips directly within the Open Cam interface.

### 4. Downloading of Media

All captured images and recorded videos are stored locally using IndexedDB. Users have the ability to download their media content directly from the application for easy sharing and storage.
